TrafficJam Predictor
Project Description
The TrafficJam Predictor is an internship project aimed at building a robust deep learning model capable of accurately predicting the location and time of the next traffic jam. Leveraging historical data from Waze, the project focuses on identifying patterns and factors contributing to heavy traffic events. The core technology employed is Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), known for their ability to capture sequential dependencies crucial for time series prediction tasks.

Approach and Methodology
1. Data Acquisition
We will gather openly available Waze datasets containing information about traffic events, including their types, timestamps, and locations. This data serves as the foundation for training the deep learning model.

2. Data Preprocessing
The collected data will undergo thorough cleaning, filtering, and transformation to ensure its suitability for training the deep learning model. High-quality and reliable training data is essential for the success of the predictive model.

3. Feature Engineering
Relevant features will be extracted from the data, including time of day, day of the week, and historical traffic patterns leading up to a jam. These features provide valuable information for the prediction model to make informed decisions.

4. Model Development
Using Python and the Keras library, we will construct an RNN-based prediction model. The RNN architecture enables the model to capture sequential dependencies and patterns in the data, making it well-suited for the intricacies of time series prediction.

5. Training and Validation
The model will be trained on the preprocessed dataset with a focus on optimizing predictive accuracy. Techniques such as cross-validation will be employed to ensure the model's robustness and generalizability across different scenarios.

6. Evaluation and Performance Metrics
The trained model will undergo evaluation using key performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. These metrics will provide insights into the model's effectiveness in predicting traffic jams and its overall performance.
